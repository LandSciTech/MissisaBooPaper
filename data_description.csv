Fire disturbance area,FIREDSTB,DTN,"Fires > 40 ha. Filtered to include fires from the preceding 30 years (i.e., 1980-2010  for comparison to the original model and 1990-2020 for the ring of fire projections)",https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/fire-disturbance-area,
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Annual report,MNRF_plan,Anthropogenic Disturbance,"Includes all harvest from 1990 to 2018 although 1990- 2002 is less exact estimated harvest. Data was not available before 1990, 1990-2010 was used for comparison to the original model and 1990-2020 for the ring of fire projections",OMNRF Data Request,Not clear whether we can distribute this data
MNRF road segments and Ontario road network,"MNRRDSEG_20201028, ORNSEGAD_20201028",TDENLF,Roads in both datasets that did not fully overlap were combined by removing roads from the Ontario road network that were within 100 m of a road in the MNRF data. Roads present in 2010 were approximated based on roads that had a year of construction in the MNRF data before 2010 or had no year of construction,https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/mnrf-road-segments and https://geohub.lio.gov.on.ca/datasets/mnrf::ontario-road-network-orn-segment-with-address,
